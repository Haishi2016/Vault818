# Vault818
This is a repository for random ideas, demos and small tools. The layout of this repository is inspired by the [Fallout Shelter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallout_Shelter) game. All programs are loosely categorized into different shelter [room types](http://www.ign.com/wikis/fallout-shelter/Rooms). Most programs are self-contained with one exception - all programs are allowed to refer to common libraries under the _Power Generator_ folder.

## Classroom (I)
As a [TEALS](https://www.tealsk12.org/) volunteer, I teach Compute Science in high schools. Classroom holds several projects for my Java programming class.

- [**PrintCircle**](./Classroom/PrintCircle) includes three different implementations of a program that prints a circle on the console. ![Java](./imgs/java.png)
- [**PrintImage**](./Classroom/PrintImage) includes a sample program that converts an image to an ASCII image. ![Java](./imgs/java.png)


## Diner
Diner is a relaxing environment where old and new ideas are causally shared. This folder is the home of small projects. There isn't a theme - everything goes here. 

- [**MathNetTests**](./Diner/MathNetTests) includes a few quick tests I wrote when I learned how to use the [MathNet.Numerics](https://numerics.mathdotnet.com/) library. ![C# 7.0](./imgs/c-sharp-7.png)
- [**MongoToGremlin**](./Diner/MongoToGremlin) is a program that transforms some MongoDB data into graphs using [Gremlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gremlin_(programming_language)). The data is originated from [this GitHub project](https://github.com/scotch-io/mean-google-maps). This code is tested against [Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/?WT.srch=1&WT.mc_id=AID__SEM_xaYpE5Fy)
